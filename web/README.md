# web

`web` is the squirrel byte web application.

i use tools like this for my personal data analysis - usually for running & biking data - & i am trying to release some of the useful components publically.

`web` is written in React is js & with frequent use of the `lodash` library.

the project was started using the `create-react-app` utility.

it uses to `react-virtualized` to maintain good performance queries return many results.

few other deps

the code quality & aesthetics are rough ... performance & functionality should be good.

perhaps more to come!
